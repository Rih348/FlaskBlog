# FlaskBlog
This web is basically a form for limited number of people. The reason why I chose this idea is my curiosity of how twitter works so I did a mini blog website

The website functionality:
1- Registration with email, username, password.
2- Login with username.
3- Posts consist of title and content.
4- Edit, delete posts.
6- every user has his/her own profile.
7- rest passwords
8- change email or username
